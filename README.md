This project shows the operation of a binary calculator. It performs a chosen operation in binary based on two operands and displays the data on the serial and also shows its verification with UVM.

## How does it work?

It has two modes of operation:

Mode 0: 
- Transmission of data directly on the serial from the ALU

Mode 1:
- Serial transmission of data from memory
- Writing data to memory

You can ses the full documentation on this [link]().
