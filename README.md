This project shows the operation of a binary calculator. It performs a chosen operation in binary based on two operands and displays the data on the serial and also shows its verification with UVM.

## How does it work?

It has two modes of operation:

Mode 0: 
- Transmission of data directly on the serial from the ALU

Mode 1:
- Serial transmission of data from memory
- Writing data to memory

You can ses the full documentation on this [link](https://github.com/SamiIonesi/Binary_Calculator/blob/main/Binary_Calculator_Documentation.pdf).

## Instructions
This repository contains the following:
- an **Arduino** script that contains the code necessary for the sensor to work
- a **Matlab** script that will display the data taken from the sensor/from the serial on a graph
- a **documentation** file and also a short **powerpoint** that show the functionality of the sensor

## Installing
1. For the Arduino script you'll need to download the:
  - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
2. For the Matlab script you'll need to install:
  - [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
  - or you can acces [Matlab Online](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html)
